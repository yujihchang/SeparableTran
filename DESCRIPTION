Title: An Unsupervised Adaptive Approach for Causal Inference in Competing Risks Data Using Separable Effects
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R:
    c(
        person(given = "Po-Chun", family = "Liao", role = "aut"),
        person(given = "Jih-Chang", family = "Yu", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "jcyu@mail.ntpu.edu.tw")
    )
Description: Implements methods from the paper on separable effects for competing risks.
    Provides a semiparametric maximum likelihood estimator (SPMLE) under a full-likelihood
    and separable-effects framework, and includes unsupervised AIC-based model selection
    for semiparametric transformation models with competing risks data.
Depends: R (>= 4.0)
