Description: This package implements the proposed methods from the paper 
    "An Unsupervised Adaptive Approach for Causal Inference in Competing Risks Data Using Separable Effects". 
    It provides a semiparametric maximum likelihood estimator (SPMLE) under a full-likelihood and separable effects framework, 
    and includes unsupervised AIC-biased model selection for semiparametric transformation models with competing risks data.
